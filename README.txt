A Pen created at CodePen.io. You can find this one at http://codepen.io/ladeyemi/pen/BKzQKj.

I decided to move my pen to github and tinker with my portfolio in my local dev environment.

I'm currently working on how to make my buttons remain central.

I'm currently improving my portfolio section by section will have a play with the colours next.
