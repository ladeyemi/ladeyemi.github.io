This was originally created and hosted at Codepen  http://codepen.io/ladeyemi/pen/BKzQKj.

I decided to move my pen to github and tinker with my portfolio in my local dev environment.

I'm currently working on how to make my buttons remain central even on a smaller screen.

I'm currently improving my portfolio section by section will have a play with the colours next, perhaps I'll change up the way it works, also need to add in accessibility to the page.

Page is now hosted on github here https://ladeyemi.github.io/ with any changes I make
