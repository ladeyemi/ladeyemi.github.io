This was originally created and hosted at Codepen  http://codepen.io/ladeyemi/pen/BKzQKj. Still there if you want to have a look at the subtle differences.

I decided to move my pen to github and tinker with my portfolio in my local dev environment.

I'm currently working on how to make my buttons remain central even on a smaller screen.

I'm currently improving my portfolio section by section will have a play with the colours next, perhaps I'll change up the way it works, also need to add in accessibility to the page.

Page is now hosted on github here https://ladeyemi.github.io/ with any changes I make

Update the buttons now are responsive - this was achieved by adding in a span class of "hidden-xs"

As my portfolio is made using bootstrap hence the xs but essentially this just means that my text is hidden on a smaller screen but the logos remain giving it that lovely responsive look and feel. I initially wanted it to keep the words but now think it all being on one line mirrors the minimal look I'm going for.
